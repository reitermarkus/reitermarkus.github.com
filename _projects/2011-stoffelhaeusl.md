The “Stoffelhäusl” is a century-old cabin in my neighbourhood my parents bought a couple of years ago. Within about a year it was restored and ever since its main use has been to host public events as well as private family gatherings. The initial iteration of the website used WordPress, which was subsequently converted to a static site hosted on GitHub Pages for simplicity.
