# Hi, I'm Markus!

I am from Tyrol, Austria. I finished my master's degree in computer science at the  [University of Innsbruck](http://www.uibk.ac.at) in 2024 and am currently working as an embedded software engineer.

I frequently contribute to open-source projects. As a long-time maintainer of the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager, I focus on maintaining Homebrew Cask and the `brew` command itself.

Currently I am mostly interested in embedded software development using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). As a member of the [Rust Embedded Working Group](https://github.com/rust-embedded), I help improve the Rust ecosystem for embedded development.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with hardware projects on Raspberry Pis, ESP32s and even custom PCBs. I also dabble in all kinds of design, these days mostly PCB design and 3D print modelling, previously also graphic, type and web design.

If you want to reach me, the best way is [via email](mailto:Markus Reiter<me@reitermark.us>?subject=This definitely isn't spam. =%29&body=Hi, Markus!).
