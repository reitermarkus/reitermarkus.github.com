# Hi, I'm Markus!

I live, work and study in Tyrol, Austria. I graduated from business academy in 2014, got my bachelor's degree in computer science at the  [University of Innsbruck](http://www.uibk.ac.at) in 2019 and am currently finishing my master's degree there as well.

I frequently contribute to open-source projects. Currently, I am mostly interested in embedded software development using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). As a member of the [Rust Embedded Working Group](https://github.com/rust-embedded) I help improve the Rust ecosystem for embedded development.

I am also a long-time maintainer of the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager with a focus on Homebrew Cask and the `brew` command itself.

In my spare time, I enjoy tinkering with hardware projects on Raspberry Pis, ESP32s and even custom PCBs. I also dabble in all kinds of design, these days mostly PCB design and 3D print modelling, previously also graphic, type and web design.

If you want to reach me, the best way is [via email](mailto:Markus Reiter<me@reitermark.us>?subject=This definitely isn't spam. =%29&body=Hi, Markus!).
